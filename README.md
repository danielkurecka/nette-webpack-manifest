# Webpack Manifest Extension for Nette Framework
This is a simple extension designed to read Webpack assets from a manifest file generated by the [webpack-manifest-plugin](https://github.com/shellscape/webpack-manifest-plugin). It adds two functions, `getWebpackAsset()` and `hasWebpackAsset()` to Latte templates. This extension only reads values from the manifest file, so you should ensure that the proper path is generated in the manifest file. When debug mode is enabled, assets are always read from the manifest file. When debug mode is disabled, assets are cached in the DI container.

## Installation
```shell
composer require daku/nette-webpack-manifest
```

## Usage
To use this extension, register it and provide the path to the manifest file in your Neon configuration file:

```neon
extensions:
	webpackManifest: Daku\Nette\Webpack\WebpackManifestExtension('%wwwDir%/static/webpack/manifest.json')
```

You can then use the `getWebpackAsset()` function to retrieve the asset path. If the asset is not found, an exception is thrown. You can also check for the existence of an asset using the `hasWebpackAsset()` function:

```latte
<link rel="stylesheet" n:if="hasWebpackAsset('app.css')" href="{$basePath}/{getWebpackAsset('app.css')}">
<script n:if="hasWebpackAsset('app.js')" src="{$basePath}/{getWebpackAsset('app.js')}"></script>
```

## Requirements
- PHP >= 8.0
- Nette >= 3
